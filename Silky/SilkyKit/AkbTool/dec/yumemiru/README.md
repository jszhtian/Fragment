ae says that "PackDat3" indicates "Entertainment Executive Engine v1.00" format,
while "yanepkDx" belongs to "Yumemuri Game Maker" engine. What confuses me is
that these formats look exactly the same, except for the magic, file extension
and linked formats. I'd dismiss it a coincidence since the format is pretty
simple, but then I found a single producer that uses both of these, which looks
like too much for a coincidence. If someone knows how these are related, please
let me know so I can improve namespaces.
